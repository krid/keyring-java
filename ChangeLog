	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/gui/*: A shiny new GUI, providing full read/write
	of items, import from other formats, export to CSV, read/write to URL
	or file.  Still needs a lot of work and testing. 
	
	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Ring.java: Beefed up to support read/write
	GUI usage.
	
	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Item.java: Beefed up to support read/write
	GUI usage.
	
	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/converters/Converter.java (convert): Change
	signature to support GUI use.
	(export): Switch from abstract method to a wrapper around convert();
	Method removed from all subclasses.
	(getConverter): Throw KeyringException instead of Exception.
	
	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/converters/CSVConverter.java (convert): Now
	handles date columns, and is generally more robust.  Can do a round
	trip conversion. 

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/KeyringException.java: Exception class.
	
	* build.xml: Change name of jar file.
	
	* lib/ostermiller-csv-excel.jar: Add missing class/java files.

GnuKeyring converter was messing up created and modified dates.  Fixes gh-1.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Item.java: s/modified/changed/g.  Duh.

	* lib/gnukeyring.jar: Fix off-by-one error in date month handling.

Major refactoring and a redesign of the build process.  The single GNU
Keyring converter has been joined by converters for CodeWallet,
eWallet and CSV, contributed by Matt Williams.

There is now an abstract base Converter class with a factory method
that will return an appropriate worker class based on the requested
type.  All the converter code has been moved to its own package in 
preparation for view/edit functionality in a futur version.  Added
KeyringUI class to handle user interaction.

All the dependencies are now collected in jar files in lib/, which are
re-jarred into the final distribution during the ant build.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Ring.java: Updated for improved security.
	(encrypt): Add salt before encrypting.
	(Ring): Generate salt from random characters.
	(getExportData): Use new signature for encrypt().
	(saltString): Generate random characters for salting.
	(DB_SALT_LENGTH, ITEM_SALT_LENGTH): Constants for salt size.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Item.java (toJSONString): Use new signature for
	Ring.encrypt().
	
	* test/*: Sample files to test converter code.
