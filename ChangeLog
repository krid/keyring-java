GnuKeyring converter was messing up created and modified dates.  Fixes gh-1.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Item.java: s/modified/changed/g.  Duh.

	* lib/gnukeyring.jar: Fix off-by-one error in date month handling.

Major refactoring and a redesign of the build process.  The single GNU
Keyring converter has been joined by converters for CodeWallet,
eWallet and CSV, contributed by Matt Williams.

There is now an abstract base Converter class with a factory method
that will return an appropriate worker class based on the requested
type.  All the converter code has been moved to its own package in 
preparation for view/edit functionality in a futur version.  Added
KeyringUI class to handle user interaction.

All the dependencies are now collected in jar files in lib/, which are
re-jarred into the final distribution during the ant build.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Ring.java: Updated for improved security.
	(encrypt): Add salt before encrypting.
	(Ring): Generate salt from random characters.
	(getExportData): Use new signature for encrypt().
	(saltString): Generate random characters for salting.
	(DB_SALT_LENGTH, ITEM_SALT_LENGTH): Constants for salt size.

	* src/com/otisbean/keyring/Item.java (toJSONString): Use new signature for
	Ring.encrypt().
	
	* test/*: Sample files to test converter code.
